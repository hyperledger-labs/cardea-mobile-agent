 # Aries Mobile Agent React Native
 
-Aries Mobile Agent React Native is an open source Aries mobile agent app. This is a project that has been created to focus the community's efforts towards a central open source project. Various different organizations and people have expressed interest in a open source community project to help focus efforts to help prevent duplication of work between projects. Aries Bifold is also intended to help get complex or specific use-case projects started faster by cloning and having a basis of an Aries agent.

 #### Mediator
 
-In order to use Aries Bifold, you must have a mediator to use with the app. Bifold is configured to use 'Implicit' mediation and requires a mediator that supports the [coordinate-mediation protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0211-route-coordination).
