# Cardea Mobile Holder

The Cardea Mobile Holder is an open-source UI agent for mobile devices, allowing users to manage self-sovereign identity (SSI) credentials on one or more Hyperledger Aries networks. Itâ€™s built using React Native to make the project approachable to a large community of developers, to ease portability between platforms, and to afford code reuse.

For an introduction to self-sovereign identity (SSI), please see [Phil Windley's article](https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml) on the topic.

- OS requirements

  > iOS >= 10.<br>
  > node >= 12<br>
  > xCode 12.4 (12.5 may now be available)<br>

## Installation

- Install Cardea Mobile Holder<br>
  `git clone https://github.com/thecardeaproject/cardea-mobile-holder.git`<br>
  OR (with ssh key)<br>
  `git clone git@github.com:thecardeaproject/cardea-mobile-holder.git`<br>
- Install dependencies<br>
  `npm install`
- Install cocoapods in ios directory<br>
  `cd ios`<br>
  `pod install`<br>
  `cd ..`<br>

### Create Env file<br>
  1. Add a blank `.env` to the root of the project<br>
  2. Add the following variables to `.env`

  ```
  MEDIATOR_URL
  GENESIS_URL
  GOVERNMENT_INVITATION
  LAB_RESULT_CRED_DEF_ID
  ```

#### Mediator URL
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/docs/MEDIATION.md) to generate a mediator link. Copy and assign it to MEDIATOR_URL.

  ```
  MEDIATOR_URL=http://mediator.example.io:4080
  ```

#### Genesis URL
You must have a genesis file url for your chosen network, such as:

- Indicio TestNet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-network/main/genesis_files/pool_transactions_testnet_genesis
- Sovrin StagingNet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis

Assign your network to GENESIS_URL

  ```
  GENESIS_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-network/main/genesis_files/pool_transactions_testnet_genesis
  ```

#### Government Invitation
To generate a government invitation, use the following steps:
  1. Start up the government agent
  2. Connect to the government agent using the Aries Toolbox
  3. Use the Aries Toolbox to instruct the government agent to create a multi-use invitation.

Assign your invitation link to GOVERNMENT_INVITATION. More details on the government invitation can be found [here](https://github.com/thecardeaproject/health-enterprise-agent-controller).

#### Lab Result Cred Def ID

## Setup

- iOS setup

  > In xCode with the project opened under `Signing & Capabilities`, use the dropdown to select your dev team, and change the `Bundle Identifier` to anything. This will change the project's `project.pbxproj` file, changes to this file should not be pushed, please undo them before submitting PRs.

- Start UP

  > iOS won't work on simulators, so plug in an iOS device, you can get it running through a terminal or open up `cardeaholder.xcworkspace` in xCode

  In Terminal:<br>
  `npm start`<br>
  Then in Second Terminal:<br>
  `npm run ios`<br>
  For Android (works on simulator):<br>
  `npm run android`<br>

## Deployment

To build the Android packages, follow the instructions under _React Native CLI Quickstart_ in the official guide:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

### Side-loading an APK

When the release packages are built, they must be signed using the release key stored in `android/app/release.keystore`. The keystore and key are protected with a password that must be set as a gradle parameter named `RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_PWD`, as demonstrated below.

Avoid entering the password in any way that will be logged, and only use the password on a hardened machine with strict access controls and full disk encryption (including swap space). The password must be stored in a secure, encrypted location at rest and should never be shared over insecure channels (esp. email).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pushd ./android

read -s -p "Password for keystore and signing key: " PWD

# Build APK and output to app/build/outputs/apk/release
./gradlew assembleRelease -PRELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_PWD=$PWD

# Build AAB and output to app/build/outputs/bundle/release
./gradlew bundleRelease -PRELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_PWD=$PWD
```

A gradle property may also be specified by setting an environment variable that is named using the `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_` well-known prefix, e.g.:

```bash
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_PWD=$PWD /gradlew bundleRelease
```

Run the following:

```bash
cd android
./build-release
```

This will output APKs to `app/build/outputs/apk/release` and AABs to `app/build/outputs/bundle/release`. Then you can side-load the APK or manually submit the AAB to an app store as desired.
